# Chacha20-Poly1305-in-Javascript
Hey yall! I am creating this repository as I made a replica Chacha20-Poly1305 implementation in Javascript for my upcoming game.

I decided to make this a public repository as some of you will find it useful.

I recommend running it using node.js, as that is the platform this was made for.

Thanks for checking it out, have a good day!
