# Chacha20-Poly1305-in-Javascript

[NOTE] I plan on updating this in the future, but for right now, you need to create 2 seperate chacha20 objects for encryption and decryption like in the test function.

Update 10/14/24: You also need to create seperate ECCops objects when generating the chacha20 keys as well.

I decided to make this a public repository as some of you will find it useful.

I recommend running it using node.js, as that is the platform this was made for.

Thanks for checking it out, have a good day!
